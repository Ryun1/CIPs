# CIP-????: Evolution of Project Catalyst

## Abstract
This CIP proposes a process for proposing changes to Project Catalyst, its internal processes and its interface to the Cardano ecosystem. This document formally enlists Project Catalyst to adhere to the CIP process. 

## Motivation
<!-- A clear explanation that introduces the reason for a proposal, its use cases and stakeholders. If the CIP changes an established design then it must outline design issues that motivate a rework. For complex proposals, authors must write a Cardano Problem Statement (CPS) as defined in CIP-9999 and link to it as the `Motivation`. -->
Project Catalyst is a dynamic program that is likely to evolve over time. There are many reasons for this:

- We may need to change the internal processes in order to improve efficiency or responsiveness.
- We may need to change the interface to the Cardano ecosystem in order to represent changes in transaction formats or other developments.
- We may wish to remove elements of the program that have been deprecated due to the addition of improved versions or changes in priorities.
- We may need to adapt to changing conditions in the Cardano ecosystem and the broader blockchain space.

At the moment there is no formal process for making such changes other than the discretion of the Project Catalyst team. This CIP provides a framework for proposing and implementing changes to Project Catalyst in a transparent and community-driven manner.

## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the proposed improvement in sufficient technical detail. In particular, it should provide enough information that an implementation can be performed solely on the basis of the design in the CIP. This is necessary to facilitate multiple, interoperable implementations. -->

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and what led to particular design decisions. It should describe alternate designs considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss significant objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

It must also explain how the proposal affects the backward compatibility of existing solutions when applicable. If the proposal responds to a CPS, the 'Rationale' section should explain how it addresses the CPS, and answer any questions that the CPS poses for potential solutions.
-->

## Path to Active

### Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Describes what are the acceptance criteria whereby a proposal becomes 'Active' -->

### Implementation Plan
<!-- A plan to meet those criteria. Or `N/A` if not applicable. -->
